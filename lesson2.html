			<h2>Lesson 2: Computational Thinking (January 16th and 17th)</h2>
			<h4>Link to Lesson:</h4>
			<a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course3/1/Teacher" target="_blank">Computational Thinking Lesson</a>

			<br><br>

			<h4>Suggestions/Tips:</h4>
			<p>It is reccomeded that you follow this lesson guide fairly closely, starting with vocabulary.</p> 
			<p>If you think it would be better, feel free to do the Computational Thinking Activity as a class. </p>
			<p>Make sure to cover the "Flash-Chat" section to pull the lesson together.</p>
			<p>Feel free to also do the attached Assessment as a class if you do not wish to print out worksheets for everyone.</p>
			
			<br>

			<h4>Corresponding QuizIt Questions:</h4>
			<p>The following questions are the same questions students will see when they log into QuizIt at the end of the lesson. Because each lesson is taught over a two day period, there are two questions on QuizIt that correspond to this lesson.</p>

			<p>These questions are shown here as a "teacher-check" to ensure that the material asked in the question has been covered in the lesson. <b>Please do not go over the answer to this question during the lesson.</b> We want to see if the students can apply what they learned in class to answer this question. </p>

			<br>
			<p>1. Using pattern matching and abstraction, make a script template for the following sentences: I love to bake cakes with my sister. I love to bake cookies with my friend. I love to bake bread with my teacher. </p>
			<ol type="A">
  					
  				<b><li>I love to bake _____ with my _____</li></b>
 					
 				<li>I _____ to bake cakes with my _____</li>
  					 
  				<li>I love to _____ cakes with _____ sister</li>
  				
  				<li>I love to _____ cookies with my _____</li>
			</ol>

			<br>

			<p>2. If you have a problem that is just a little different from a problem that you have a solution for, what should you do?</p>
			<ol type= "A">
				<b><li>Use abstraction to pull out the differences between the two problems to make one soution work for both problems</li></b>
				<li>Give up</li>
				<li>Use the exact same answer from the similar problem</li>
				<li>Re-do the problem completely. The similar problem won't help you find the answer</li>
			</ol>
			
			<br>

			<h4>Additional Practice Questions:</h4>
			<p>Feel free to go over these questions in class as an "end of lesson review"</p>

			<br>
			
			<p>What is the definition of decompose?</p>
			<ol type= "A">
				<li>Combine smaller pieces to make a problem more whole</li>
				<b><li>Break a problem down into smaller pieces</li></b>
				<li>Pulling out specific differences to make one solution work for multiple problems</li>
				<li>Finding similarities between things</li>
			</ol>

			<p>What is the definition of abstraction?</p>
			<ol type= "A">
				<li>Organizing many different items into similar groups</li>
				<li>Break a problem down into smaller pieces</li>
				<b><li>Pulling out specific differences to make one solution work for multiple problems</li></b>
				<li>A list of steps you can follow to finish a task</li>
			</ol>

			<p>What is the definition of pattern matching?</p>
			<ol type= "A">
				<b><li>Finding similarities between things</li></b>
				<li>Break a problem down into smaller pieces</li>
				<li>Looking closely at every step to determine where the mistake is</li>
				<li>A list of steps you can follow to finish a task</li>
			</ol>

			<p>What is the definition of an algorithm?</p>
			<ol type= "A">
				<li>Finding similarities between things</li>
				<li>Break a problem down into smaller pieces</li>
				<li>Pulling out specific differences to make one solution work for multiple problems</li>
				<b><li>A list of steps you can follow to finish a task</li></b>
			</ol>

			<p>If a problem is too hard, what should you try to do?</p>
			<ol type= "A">
				<li>Break down the problem into smaller pieces</li>
				<li>Find similarities between things</li>
				<li>Ask for help</li>
				<b><li>All of the above</li></b>
			</ol>
