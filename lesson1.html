			<h2>Lesson 1: Intro (January 14th and 15th)</h2>
			<h4>Link to Lesson:</h4>
			<a href="http://static.zerorobotics.mit.edu/docs/team-activities/ProgrammingPeanutButterAndJelly.pdf" target="_blank">Intro Lesson: Making a PBJ</a>

			<br><br>

			<h4>Suggestions/Tips:</h4>
			<p>Feel free to use any other simple tasks in place of making a PBJ. Other tasks could be: drawing a cat on the chalkboard, walking to a certain place in the room, cutting paper into a certain shape etc.</p>
			<p>Make sure to take all directions from the students very literal. The students should be slightly frustrated at how specific they need to be with their instructions.</p>
			<p>After the activity, make sure to drive home the point that coding requires very specific, line by line, instructions.</p>

			<br>

			<h4>Corresponding QuizIt Questions:</h4>
			<p>The following questions are the same questions students will see when they log into QuizIt at the end of the lesson. Because each lesson is taught over a two day period, there are two questions on QuizIt that correspond to this lesson.</p>

			<p>These questions are shown here as a "teacher-check" to ensure that the material asked in the question has been covered in the lesson. <b>Please do not go over the answer to this question during the lesson.</b> We want to see if the students can apply what they learned in class to answer this question. </p>

			<br>

			<p>1. Imagine you are trying to tell the computer how to put a cake in the oven, which of the following is the BEST set of instructions for the computer? (the correct answer is bolded)</p>
			<ol type="A">
  				<li>
  					<ol type= "1">
  						<li>Open the oven</li>
  						<li>Put the pan in the oven</li>
  						<li>Close the oven door
  					</ol>
  				</li>
 				<li>
 					<ol type= "1">
  						<li>Put oven mits on</li>
  						<li>Grab the pan with the uncooked cake batter with both hands</li>
  						<li>Put the pan in the oven</li>
  						<li>Close the oven door </li>
  					</ol> 
 				</li>
  				<li>
  					<ol type= "1">
  						<li>Put the cake in the oven</li>
  					</ol> 
  				</li>
  				<b><li>
  					<ol type= "1">
  						<li>Put oven mits on both hands</li>
  						<li>Open the oven</li>
  						<li>Grab the pan with the uncooked cake batter with both hands so that the cake remains facing up</li>
  						<li>Put the cake pan with the batter on the middle shelf of the oven</li>
  						<li>Close the oven door</li>
  						<li>Set a timer for 20 minutes</li>
  					</ol>
  				</li></b>
			</ol>

			<br>

			<p>2. When dealing with computers, it is important to remember that:</p>
			<ol type= "A">
				<b><li>Computers do what they are told and nothing more</li></b>
				<li>Computers are able to think on their own</li>
				<li>The computer will be able to guess what you meant</li>
				<li>The computer knows how to "read between the lines"</li>
			</ol>

			<br>

			<h4>Additional Practice Questions:</h4>
			<p>Feel free to go over these questions in class as an "end of lesson review"</p>

			<br>

			<p>True or False: it is important to be very thorough while programming because computers take everything literally.</p>
			<ol type= "A">
				<b><li>True</li></b>
				<li>False</li>
			</ol>
