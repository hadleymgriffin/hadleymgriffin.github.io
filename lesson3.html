			<h2>Lesson 3: More Computational Thinking</h2>
			<h4>Link to Lesson:</h4>
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0wg-BMG3TdwsShAyH_0Z1xpFnpVcMvpYJceHGWex_c/edit" target="_blank">More Computational Thinking Lesson</a>

			<h4>Suggestions/Tips:</h4>
			<p>This lesson is a review of some vocabulary in lesson 2 and also covers new vocabulary.</p> 
			<p>Follow the suggested "Teaching Tips" in this lesson plan to provide hands on explanations of the new vocabulary for the students</p>
			
			<h4>Corresponding QuizIt Question:</h4>
			<p>The following question is the same question students will see when they log into QuizIt. This question is shown here as a "teacher-check" to ensure that the material asked in the question has been covered in the lesson. Please do not go over the answer to this question during the lesson. We want to see if the students can apply what they learned in class to answer this question. </p>
			<p>What is an example of algorithm design? (the correct answer is bolded)</p>
			<ol type="A">
  					
  				<li>Gathering the number of brothers and sisters everyone in the room has</li>
 					
 				<b><li>Writing a recipe for cookies</li></b>
  					 
  				<li>Drawing a graph of the number of people with birthdays in April</li>
  				
  				<li>Modeling how the solar system works</li>
			</ol>
