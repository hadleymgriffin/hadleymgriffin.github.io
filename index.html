			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>This page is intended to give you all the information you need to know about QuizIt (the learning software) and the corresponding lessons.</p>

			<h2>How to Use the Lesson Guides</h2>

			<p>Each lesson will have a link to the lesson guide, suggestions for teaching, the question that will be asked on QuizIt that day, and additional practice questions. The material taught in the lesson will correspond to the QuizIt question that day, so it is important to only have the students take the daily QuizIt quiz question (more on this below) after the entire lesson has been taught.</p>


			<h2>How to Use QuizIt</h2>

			<p>Each day, there will be a new question on QuizIt that will correspond to the lesson from that day. We reccomend that the students log onto QuizIt at the end of the lesson to test their retention of knowledge on the topic taught that day. </p>

			<p>Having students use the QuizIt tool at the end of the lesson should only take about 5 minutes.</p>

			<p>Here is the link to the QuizIt tool: <a href="http://cidsequizit.fulton.asu.edu" target="_blank">http://cidsequizit.fulton.asu.edu</a> </p>

			<h4>The Daily Quiz: </h4>

			<p>The student will simply click on the "Today's Quiz" link, read the question, select a multiple choice answer, and then describe in words why they chose the answer they did. QuizIt will show the student whether or not they got the answer correct. If the answer was incorrect, the student will have the chance to answer again (and until they get the correct answer). To the side of the question, the student will see other student's reasonings for seleciton under the "Student Discussion Board" and also will have the opportunity to post a question if necessary. Once the student has successfully answered the question, they are done for that day.</p>

			<h4>Reviewing Prevoius Questions: </h4>

			<p>The student also has the option to review or retry any questions from prior days. To do this, click on the "Question History" link, find the question to review and click the correspoinding teal button to review or the yellow button to retry. Reviewing and retrying old questions is not required.</p>
